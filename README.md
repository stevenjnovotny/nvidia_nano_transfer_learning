# nvidia_nano_transfer_learning
This code explores transfer learning on the nano. The code nano_transfer_learning_example.py is used for creating the new model. This was done by freezing the weights in an inception_v3 model and adding layers to accomodate the cifar10 dataset.

The model was saved and run with the load_run_model.py file on the nano.
